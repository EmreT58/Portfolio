	            			<b>Speed:</b> We carry our own stock. The delivery times are shown against each item on our website. You can therefore be confident of the delivery time when you place your order. The great majority of our products are in stock. For items in stock in the Netherlands, if you place your order before mid-afternoon, you should receive your delivery within two or three working days.

	            			<b>Service:</b>
	            		 	Should you have any problems with your tablet, we offer help and advice. Problems that are software-related can usually be solved by phone or email. Where the hardware itself appears to be faulty, we'll try to isolate the problem (to the pen, tablet, etc) and then suggest the best course of action. We'll attempt to keep the inconvenience to you to a minimum, so that you can be up and running with your tablet again as soon as possible.

	            			Tablet4U has sold WACOM tablets since 1999 and we therefore have a good understanding of products. This is obvious not only from our website but also from the personal help and advice we can give you in purchasing a tablet. This advice is available both by email and telephone. We try to answer all the questions you have.
